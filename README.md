# AniHelper
First WPF project, Anime recommendation tool.

Pretty simple design, attempts to scrape data from myanimelist.net and recommend anime based on genre preferences.

Somewhat flawed due to how ratings work... may remake this project in the future using different methods.

Problem with ratings: Second and any additional seasons skew the popularity of an anime, people who liked the anime continue watching and the ratings are much higher compared to the first season. As well, additional seasons count towards the original anime, thus giving it more chances to appear. Need a better way to balance multiple seasons.
